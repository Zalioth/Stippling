This is the project's root directory.
It contains the following directories:

dependencies
doc
included software
use examples
source

The "dependencies" directory contains the libraries the project depends upon. Since the project is multiplatform, it contains two subdirectories (linux and windows) that each contain another readme.txt file explaining how to obtain and install the libraries in each case.

The "doc" directory contains the project's documentation (in Spanish only for now).

The "included software" directory contains the contributions made by Germán Arroyo (some of said contributions are examples and code that were not used in the project) as originally received.

The "use examples" directory contains some pictures and CSG trees used to test the application. The battery test also includes some screenshots showing the use of the application and its results.

The "source" directory contains the project's source code.
Its subdirectory "stippling" is the one that must be copied and from which (since it contains the CMakeLists.txt file) the compilation commands (see chapter 11 of the documentation) will be executed. Please bear in mind that a Graphics card that supports OpenGL 3.3 is a hard requirement of the project.
